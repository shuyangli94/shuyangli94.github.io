                        <p align="left"><br>In my work with the Structured Products team (Mortgage Waterfall Infrastructure), I helped to design and implement a Spark-based infrastructure for high bandwidth data processing jobs. We wrote a series of applications to wrap common data-access, filtering, and testing paradigms, so other members of the Structured Products group could write test logic as a self-contained plugin and farm the job out to our Spark cluster. We achieved a 100x+ speedup for some jobs due to parallelization, and abstracted away Spark application boilerplate.
                            <br><br>

Over the course of 10 months, we built a platform for data science and machine learning on top of the firm's centralized data store. Our goal was to allow anybody to classify and regress on arbitrary datasets without needing a deep background in programming for machine learning. One client was an internal data platforms team, which used our platform to better predict expected runtimes for their data ingestion workflow.

Our application allowed the GSAM FI team to consume a vastly greater quantity of market messages and made it available for further analysis by traders. It is currently a production system.

                        <p align="left"><br>This was a project that I worked on as a Summer Research Intern at <a href="http://castlelab.princeton.edu/">CASTLE Lab</a> at Princeton University in the summer of 2014. The objective was to find optimal policies in an energy allocation problem. The model contained a battery, power grid, wind energy, and demand, with the latter three stochastic variables. I investigated the performance of Q-Learning and SARSA given different learning rates.

                            The simulator was written in Java, building on the <a href="http://burlap.cs.brown.edu/">BURLAP Learning Algorithm Library</a>. Graphics and metrics were produced in Excel and MATLAB.

                        <i><h3>Optimal Learning</h3></i>
                        <p align="left"><br>This was a project that I worked on for <a href="http://optimallearning.princeton.edu/">ORF 418: Optimal Learning</a> in Spring 2014. I worked with Max Kaplan. We created an algorithm for pricing Express Lanes on the I-110 Freeway using Optimal Learning techniques. Specifically, we tested the Knowledge Gradient, Interval Estimation, Pure Exploitation, and Constrained Exploration algorithms with linear and logistic belief models.
