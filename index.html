                      <p>My research focuses on the intersection of natural language processing (NLP) and recommender systems. I explore personalization in natural language generation and question-answering, subjectivity in knowledge bases, and mining the wealth of data available publicly online. My previous research includes structured text generation, sentiment analysis, and spatial clustering in neuroscience.</p>
                      <p>I also focus on extracting large-scale, useful and interesting datasets from publicly available sources to analyze and make available for research.</p>

                                We study the size and clustering of TRP-channel expressing neurons in the trigeminal dura. Our results suggest that TRPV1 and TRPA1 but not TRPM8 channels likely contribute to the excitation of dural afferent neurons and the subsequent activation of the headache circuit. These results provide an anatomical basis for understanding further the functional significance of TRP channels in headache pathophysiology.

                                    I helped to design and implement a Spark-based infrastructure for high bandwidth data processing jobs. We wrote a series of applications to wrap common data-access, filtering, and testing paradigms, so other members of the Structured Products group could write test logic as a self-contained plugin and farm the job out to our Spark cluster. We achieved a 100x+ speedup for some jobs due to parallelization, and abstracted away Spark application boilerplate.

This entailed identifying data shape features for semi-structured text data received for over 2.5 million securities and clustering on time-series data for each security.

Our goal was to allow anybody to classify and regress on arbitrary datasets without needing a deep background in programming for machine learning. One client was an internal data platforms team, which used our platform to better predict expected runtimes for their data ingestion workflow.

Our application allowed the GSAM FI team to consume a vastly greater quantity of market messages and made it available for further analysis by traders. It is currently a production system.

The model contained a battery, power grid, wind energy, and demand, with the latter three stochastic variables. I investigated the performance of Q-Learning and SARSA given different learning rates.
