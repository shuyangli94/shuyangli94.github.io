                        <p align="left"><br>In my work with the Structured Products team (Mortgage Waterfall Infrastructure), I helped to design and implement a Spark-based infrastructure for high bandwidth data processing jobs. We wrote a series of applications to wrap common data-access, filtering, and testing paradigms, so other members of the Structured Products group could write test logic as a self-contained plugin and farm the job out to our Spark cluster. We achieved a 100x+ speedup for some jobs due to parallelization, and abstracted away Spark application boilerplate.
                            <br><br>
                            The platform infrastructure was written in Python with jobs distributed via <a href="http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html">pySpark</a>.

                        <p align="left"><br>As part of my work with the Quality Control team in Mortgage Waterfall Infrastructure, I am currently investigating how various mortgage-backed securities (pools, generics, CMOs) can be clustered by the shape of the data we regularly receive for each security. This entails identifying data shape features for semi-structured text data received for over 2.5 million securities and clustering on time-series data for each security.
                            <br><br>
                            The application was written in Python, using <a href="https://spark.apache.org/mllib/">Spark MLlib</a> library for feature processing and clustering, and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> to store time series data, accessed programmatically via <a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a>.

Over the course of 10 months, we built a platform for data science and machine learning on top of the firm's centralized data store. Our goal was to allow anybody to classify and regress on arbitrary datasets without needing a deep background in programming for machine learning. One client was an internal data platforms team, which used our platform to better predict expected runtimes for their data ingestion workflow.

                        <p align="left"><br>This was the project team I worked on for Grey Wolf on Goldman Sachs Asset Management - Fixed Income (GSAM FI) as a new Technology Analyst in the fall of 2016. Over 6 weeks, our team built a system to consume FIX messages from several marketplaces, parse them into a standardized object, and store the messages in a database. Our application allowed the GSAM FI team to consume a vastly greater quantity of market messages and made it available for further analysis by traders. It is currently a production system.
                            <br><br>
                            The application was written in Java, using the <a href="http://www.quickfixj.org/">QuickFIX/J</a> library for FIX message decoding.

We worked with Accounting Services to build a tool that could automatically index certain values from images of invoices. They received invoices through email or fax and scanned them into .tiff files. Our algorithm relied on segmentation of individual values to produce structured output and templating to identify likely segment locations.

                            The program was written in Python, using the <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a> library for fast array operations and <a href="http://scikit-image.org/">scikit-image</a> library for image processing.

We worked with several different Operations groups to produce a tool for automatically assigning tasks to available analysts. This took into account available analysts, their expected bandwidth for the remainder of the day, their proficiency with incoming tasks, and implemented a Maker-Checker process. The tool is to be run by managers, and outputs a list of each person's assignments as well as a list of unassigned tasks with reasoning listed.

Here, we investigate the use of rich features to extend the bag-of-words model for sentiment analysis using machine learning in the movie review domain. We focus on subjectivity analysis and sentence position features. In addition, I created a manually labeled set of subjective and summary sentences for 2000 reviews in the Cornell IMDB movie review corpus. The full title of the thesis is <i>Exploring Rich Features for Sentiment Analysis with Various Machine Learning Models</i>.

We helped the campus career center provide resources for career exploration and preparation in a way that was better suited for the undergraduate population. We created a regular mentorship program for underclassmen and upperclassmen who had experience with various research and industry roles. We also held a well-attended career exploration workshop on campus.
